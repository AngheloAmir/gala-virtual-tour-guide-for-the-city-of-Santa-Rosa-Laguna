    "description": "The Santa Rosa Arch is also known as Bantayan Bato, is one of the famous landmarks in Santa Rosa. During the Spanish era, it serves as an outpost to protect the town against marauding pirates. It was constructed in 1792, but it was renovated in 1931 by the municipal president Jose Zavalla to give way to vehicles. The reconstruction was modeled to the style of  Arc De Triomphe in Champs Elysees in Paris, France (santarosacity.gov.ph). The design of the new Arch was done by David Dia - a famous sculpturer in Santa Rosa.",
