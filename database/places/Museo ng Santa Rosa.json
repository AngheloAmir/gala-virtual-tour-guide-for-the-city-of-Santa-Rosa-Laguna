    "description": "The Museo of Santa Rosa was the former city municipal town hall during the Spanish era. It is a two-story building that was constructed in 1828. In 2006, it became a Santa Rosa Museum that displays artifacts and furniture from the pre-Spanish era to World War 2. It is also used as a library and the office of the Tourism Department of Santa Rosa. Mesmerize with its former beauty as it still depicts how Spanish-era municipal building looks. The presence of the Covid-19 pandemic makes the museum close for tourists.",
