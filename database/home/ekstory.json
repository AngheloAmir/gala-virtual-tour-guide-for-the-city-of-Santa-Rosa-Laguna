            "paragraph": "The Enchanted Kingdom (EK) is the largest and popular theme park in the Philipines. The theme park land area is 25 hectares (62 acres), and it is big enough to accommodate thousands of tourists. The theme park was founded by Mario and Cynthia Mamon - a family who frequently visit local theme parks in the Philipines. There were a lot of rides to choose from, a roller-coster to splashy (wet) rides. I remember the first time I visited the theme park when I was young, it was a fun and unforgettable experience. However, the Covid-19 virus and the IATF regulation make the theme park closed (as of written)."

            "paragraph": "Last year, there were open although at reduced capacity. The theme park is able to celebrate its anniversary in October 2020. However, the MECQ that happen in March 2021, makes the theme park closed again. When the MECQ is lifted up, there was a plan to reopen the theme park on June 05 with all of the indoor tourist attractions closed. But, it was short-lived and it was again closed as the Covid-19 cases in Laguna continue to rise despite the vaccination. Many people are still hoping that the theme park will reopen again and experience again the \"Magic\"."
